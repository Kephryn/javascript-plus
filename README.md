# JS+
Javascript Plus is a proof of concept and has only been used for personal projects. 
This package is an ES6 Module which uses Imports and Exports

I would not recommend using this in a production environment. 

## ActiveDOM
The ActiveDOM package is a useful tool for easily generating: XHTML, HTML, HTML5, SVG, MATHML and XML

## AssetLoader
Something required but not yet built. 

## EventInterface
The Javascript Event Interface is an experimental idea to try to solve some of 
the issues that native javascript doesn't address.


## SelectorInterface
This project is a wrapper that returns a node list of elements. The wrapper accepts 
ID Selectors (getElementById) CSS selectors (querySelector) or xPath selector.

## Shadow
The shadow project is a wrapper to create shadowDom elements.
