# JS+
Javascript Plus is a proof of concept and has only been used for personal projects. 
This package is an ES6 Module which uses Imports and Exports.

** I would not recommend using this in a production environment. **

There is no support for Internet Explorer as that browser should be considered dead. 
Also no thought (yet) was given to support browsers other than Chrome (blink) and Firefox.

## ActiveDOM
The ActiveDOM package is a useful tool for easily generating: XHTML, HTML, HTML5, SVG, MATHML and XML

## AssetLoader
Something required but not yet built. 

## EventInterface
The Javascript Event Interface is an experimental idea to try to solve some of 
the issues that native javascript doesn't address.


## SelectorInterface

ID Selectors (getElementById) CSS selectors (querySelector) or xPath selector.

## Shadow
