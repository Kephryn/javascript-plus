 * Who ever knew I would give this project a new chance at life. 
 * 
 * This project was started about 15 years ago in 2003. I abandoned the project 
 * because popular well tested frameworks were just better at the time.
 * 
 * This is used as a test bench for unconventional or experimental ideas
 * 
 * So far, ActiveDom, JEI (JavaScript Event Interface) and a basic 
 * select class have been added
